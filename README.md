README

Okay, this is a chat app but in the command line interface (CLI). Use this thing to connect to xchat2 then you can start chatting with people.


GETTING start

1. clone it
`git clone https://github.com/nex-era-th/xchat2-cli.git`

2. `cd /dir-you-put-it`
3. `npm install`
4. sign-up
`$ node xchat2-cli.js`
you'll get prompt

`> -signup`

follow the steps

4. login
once you get userName, password, login by
`> @john`

implies @john is your userName and then put password

there's help for web version, for cli will be done later

HAPPY CHATTING
